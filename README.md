# Neopixel_Fun
This is all the fun things I am doing with Neopixels.
The Neopixal_Tutorial.ino script just has an overview of how colors work, how to turn on lights, and the basic parts of a neopixal script. The Tutorial_2 script will show how to make lights snake up the strip and light up random lights.
